##### More info about the variables is in <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/STUDENT+ALCOHOL+CONSUMPTION>


#### Four variables and the hypothesis of their relatioship with alcohol consumption

##### Variables:

1. Family relationships (famrel, 1-5)
  - Better family relationships decrease alcohol consumption
  
2. Sex, (sex, F/M)
  - Males drink more tha females
  
3. Address (address, urban/rural)
  - Urban living decreases alcohol consumption
  
4. Going out (goout, 1-5)
  - Going out increases alcohol consumption
  

#### Exploration of the variables relationship with high use of alcohol

##### Urban living seems to correlate negatively with the high use of alcohol. 



### Summary of the fitted model shows that the variables do affect persons use of alcohol. P values suggest that all variables are statistically significant and errors aren't too bad.

### Coefficients of the model as odds ratios and their confidence intervals shows that familyrelationships and urban address make it less likely to individual to have high alcohol consumption. Going out a lot and being a male makes it more likely to individual to consume a lot of alcohol.

### Inaccutarely classified individuals. 
Predictions classifie 12 people falsely to high consume alcohol and 70 people falsely to not high use of alcohol.


| H/P    | FALSE  | TRUE  |       
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| FALSE  | 256    |    12 |       
| TRUE   | 70     |    44 | 

### Training error is 0.2156597 ~ 22 %, so the model works better than just guessing.

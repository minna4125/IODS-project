##### More info about the variables is in <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/STUDENT+ALCOHOL+CONSUMPTION>


#### Four variables and the hypothesis of their relatioship with alcohol consumption

##### Variables:

1. Family relationships (famrel, 1-5)
  - Better family relationships decrease alcohol consumption
  
2. Sex, (sex, F/M)
  - Males drink more tha females
  
3. Address (address, urban/rural)
  - Urban living decreases alcohol consumption
  
4. Going out (goout, 1-5)
  - Going out increases alcohol consumption

##### There was more people that had excelent relationship with their family in the group of less alcohol use, but both groups median was at the same point. This doesn't oppose the hypothesis but it isn't enough to confirm it either.

##### People who go out seem to be drinking more. This supports the hypothesis that going out correlates with more drinking.

##### There isn't really enough people in the study who had rural address to say anything about it's effect on drinking compared to urban living. 



### Summary of the fitted model shows that the variables coexist with persons high use of alcohol to some exctenct. Numbers look okay, but it doesn't tell the whole story.

### Inaccutarely classified individuals. Predictions classifie 12 people falsely to high consume alcohol and 70 people falsely to not high use of alcohol. 
| H/P    | FALSE  | TRUE  |       
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| FALSE  | 256    |    12 |       
| TRUE   | 70     |    44 | 

### Training error is 0.2156597 ~ 22 % which isn't too bad.
